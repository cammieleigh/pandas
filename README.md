# Overview

For this project I wanted to learn more about data analysis. This was my first time really looking into this
and so it was interesting to see all of the different libraries that can be used. 

I have a minor in Mandarin, and so I wanted to see how common different radicals (the parts of a character
that are used in dictionaries) are in the Chinese language. I also wanted to see the most common words (this includes how they are pronounced as well as their tone).

# Data Analysis Results

My questions were:
-What is the most common radical in Mandarin
-What is the most common word (both romanized spelling and tone)

To absolutely no one's surprise 氵was the most common radical showing up in my dataset of over 9500 characters, 456 times

The most common word was yì showing up 79 times.

# Development Environment

I used Python for this project, and along with that I used Pandas. In order to able to use the library, I also used Anaconda as well as Jupyter notebooks in order to run my queries.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to make some more in depth queries that can look even further in the pronunciation of the words
* I would also like to make the pie chart more clear
